# Blackjack (21) Card Game *(MVP edition)*
### Using HTML, CSS, & JS
- This is a simple blackjack card game.
- It is 1 player vs. the dealer(computer).
- Click 'New Game' button to deal cards.
- Your cards (along with dealers) are shown as text, along with the total 'score' of the hand.
- Click either 'Hit Me!' or 'Stay' button, first to 21 wins.
- Dealer must hit if score is less than 17.
- Ties can occur.
- This is a minimal viable product: no cards are yet rendered and there is no betting (soon to come).
